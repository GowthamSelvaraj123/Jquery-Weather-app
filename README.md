<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This project is a simple yet powerful weather application built using jQuery and the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to search for weather information by entering the name of a country. The application fetches real-time weather data for the next five days and displays it in a user-friendly format.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Search Functionality: Users can search for weather conditions by entering the name of any country.</li>
<li>Real-time Weather Data: The app retrieves current weather conditions, including temperature, weather conditions (like clear, cloudy, etc.), and more.</li>
<li>5-Day Forecast: Displays a detailed 5-day weather forecast with hourly updates.</li>
<li>User-Friendly Interface: The app presents the data in a clear and organized manner, with easy-to-read weather information.</li>
<li>Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and works across various devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the app.</li>
<li>jQuery: For handling DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.</li>
<li>AJAX: To make asynchronous requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.</li>
<li>OpenWeatherMap API: For fetching weather data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<li>Search Input: The user enters the name of a country in the search field.</li>
<li>AJAX Request: When the user clicks the submit button, an AJAX request is made to the OpenWeatherMap API, passing the country name as a parameter.</li>
<li>Data Processing: The API returns weather data, which is then processed and displayed in the app.</li>
<li>Display Results: The app shows the weather forecast for the next 5 days, including the average temperature and weather conditions for each day.</li>
